# Web and cloud Group 1


## Introduction

This repository focus on web and cloud computing. In today's world, it is not uncommon to handle data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software (i.e. Big Data). Cloud computing is a popular way to handle big data. It is an on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

In this project, we will demostrate  
(1) How to use the web as a platform for data collection, computation, and publishing.  
(2) Accessing data via scraping and APIs.  
(3) Using the cloud for tasks that are beyond the capability of your local computing resources.  

In particular, we will be building and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

The dataset is on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). This folder has the output of different climate models as features, and our ultimate goal is to build an ensemble model on these outputs and compare the results with the actual rainfall. At the end of the project, a machine learning model will be deployed in the cloud for others to use.

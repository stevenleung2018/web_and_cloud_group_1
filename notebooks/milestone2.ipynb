    "Milestone 2: Your team is planning to migrate to the cloud. AWS gave 400$ (100$ each) to your team to support this. As part of this initiative, your team needs to set up a server in the cloud, a collaborative environment for your team, and later move your data to the cloud. After that, your team can wrangle the data in preparation for machine learning.\n",
